### Document is too long

This  error occurs when you're sending a document that exceeds the size limitations of the API.

We advise to use a library to split your text into small chunks. (e.g. with the `npm i embedbase-js` `splitText` function)


```js
import { splitText } from 'embedbase-js/dist/main/split';

const text = `some very long text`

splitText(text, { maxTokens: 500, }, async ({chunk}) => {
    // do whatever you want with the chunks
    // in this case we sent it to https://embedbase.xyz
    const data = await embedbase.dataset('some-data-set').add(chunk)
})
```
