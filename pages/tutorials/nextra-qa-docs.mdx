Today we're going to learn how to build a system to ask ChatGPT questions and get accurate answers about your documentation.
The whole project we are going to build is available [here](https://github.com/different-ai/embedbase-nextra-docs-template). You can also try an interactive version at https://docs.embedbase.xyz.

## Overview

<Image src="/qa-overview.png" width={800} height={500} />
We're going to cover a few things here, but the big picture is that:{' '}

1. We'll need to store our content in a database
2. We'll get the user to type a query
3. We'll search the database for the results that are most similar to the user query (more on that later)
4. We'll create a "context" based on the top 5 most similar results matching the query and ask ChatGPT:
   > Answer the question based on the context below, and if the question can't be answered based on the context, say "I don't know"
   >
   > Context:
   > [CONTEXT]
   >
   > \---
   >
   > Question:
   > [QUESTION]
   >
   > Answer:

## Diving into the implementation

Alright let's get started

Here's what you'll be needing for this tutorial

- [Embedbase api key](https://embedbase.xyz), a database that allows you to find "most similar results". Not all databases are suited for this kind of job. Today we'll be using Embedbase which allows you to do just that. Embedbase allows you to find "semantic similarity" between a search query and stored content.
- [OpenAI api key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys): that's for the ChatGPT part.
- [Nextra](https://nextra.site): [NodeJS installed](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Write the Embedbase and OpenAI API keys in `.env`:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY="<YOUR KEY>"
EMBEDBASE_API_KEY="<YOUR KEY>"
```

As a reminder, we will create a **QA documentation powered by ChatGPT** with the amazing documentation framework [Nextra](https://nextra.site/) which allows you to write documentation using NextJS, tailwindcss and MDX (Markdown + React). We will also use [Embedbase](https://embedbase.xyz/) as a database and [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) to use ChatGPT.

### Creating a Nextra doc

You can find and use the official Nextra documentation template [here](https://github.com/shuding/nextra-docs-template).
Once you have created your documentation with this template, open it with your favorite editor.

```bash
# we won't use "pnpm" here, rather the traditional "npm"
rm pnpm-lock.yaml
npm i
npm run dev
```

Now just head to https://localhost:3000.

Try to edit some of the `.mdx` documents and see the content changing.

### Preparing and storing the documents

The first step requires us to store our documentation in Embedbase. There's a small caveat, though, this works better if we store relatively small chunks in the DB. We'll chunk our text by sentences. Let's start by writing a script called `sync.js` in the folder `scripts`.

You'll need the `glob` library to list files `npm i glob@8.1.0` (we'll use the 8.1.0 version).

```js
const glob = require('glob')
const fs = require('fs')

const sync = async () => {
  // 1. read all files under pages/* with .mdx extension
  // for each file, read the content
  const documents = glob.sync('pages/**/*.mdx').map(path => ({
    // we use as id /{pagename} which could be useful to
    // provide links in the UI
    id: path
      .replace('pages/', '/')
      .replace('index.mdx', '')
      .replace('.mdx', ''),
    // content of the file
    data: fs.readFileSync(path, 'utf-8')
  }))

  // 2. here we split the documents in chunks, you can do it in many different ways, pick the one you prefer
  // split documents into chunks of 100 lines
  const chunks = []
  documents.forEach(document => {
    const lines = document.data.split('\n')
    const chunkSize = 100
    for (let i = 0; i < lines.length; i += chunkSize) {
      const chunk = lines.slice(i, i + chunkSize).join('\n')
      chunks.push({
        // and use id like path/chunkIndex
        id: document.id + '/' + i,
        data: chunk
      })
    }
  })
}

sync()
```

Now that we have our chunks we need to store them in a DB, we'll extend our script so that it adds the chunks to Embedbase.

To query Embedbase, we'll install the version `2.6.9` of `node-fetch` by running `npm i node-fetch@2.6.9`.

```js
const fetch = require('node-fetch')

// your Embedbase api key
const apiKey = process.env.EMBEDBASE_API_KEY

const sync = async () => {
  // ...
  // 3. we then insert the data in Embedbase
  const response = await fetch(
    'https://embedbase-hosted-usx5gpslaq-uc.a.run.app/v1/documentation',
    {
      // "documentation" is your dataset ID
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        Authorization: 'Bearer ' + apiKey,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        documents: chunks
      })
    }
  )
  const data = await response.json()
  console.log(data)
}

sync()
```

Great, you can run it now

```bash
EMBEDBASE_API_KEY="<YOUR API KEY>" node scripts/sync.js
```

If it worked well you should be seeing:

<Image src="/sync-response.png" width={800} height={500} />

### Getting the user's query

Now, we will modify the Nextra documentation theme to replace the built-in search bar with one that will be ChatGPT-powered.
We'll add a `Modal` component to `theme.config.tsx` with the following content:

```tsx
// update the imports
import { DocsThemeConfig, useTheme } from 'nextra-theme-docs'
const Modal = ({ children, open, onClose }) => {
  const theme = useTheme()
  if (!open) return null
  return (
    <div
      style={{
        position: 'fixed',
        top: 0,
        left: 0,
        right: 0,
        bottom: 0,
        backgroundColor: 'rgba(0,0,0,0.5)',
        zIndex: 100
      }}
      onClick={onClose}
    >
      <div
        style={{
          position: 'absolute',
          top: '50%',
          left: '50%',
          transform: 'translate(-50%, -50%)',
          backgroundColor: theme.resolvedTheme === 'dark' ? '#1a1a1a' : 'white',
          padding: 20,
          borderRadius: 5,
          width: '80%',
          maxWidth: 700,
          maxHeight: '80%',
          overflow: 'auto'
        }}
        onClick={e => e.stopPropagation()}
      >
        {children}
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Now we want to create the search bar:

```tsx
// update the imports
import React, { useState } from 'react'
// we create a Search component
const Search = () => {
  const [open, setOpen] = useState(false)
  const [question, setQuestion] = useState('')
  // ...
  // All the logic that we will see later
  const answerQuestion = () => {}
  // ...
  return (
    <>
      <input
        placeholder="Ask a question"
        // We open the modal here
        // to let the user ask a question
        onClick={() => setOpen(true)}
        type="text"
      />
      <Modal open={open} onClose={() => setOpen(false)}>
        <form onSubmit={answerQuestion} className="nx-flex nx-gap-3">
          <input
            placeholder="Ask a question"
            type="text"
            value={question}
            onChange={e => setQuestion(e.target.value)}
          />
          <button type="submit">Ask</button>
        </form>
      </Modal>
    </>
  )
}
```

Last, update the config to set the search bar we created:

```tsx
const config: DocsThemeConfig = {
  logo: <span>My Project</span>,
  project: {
    link: 'https://github.com/shuding/nextra-docs-template'
  },
  chat: {
    link: 'https://discord.com'
  },
  docsRepositoryBase: 'https://github.com/shuding/nextra-docs-template',
  footer: {
    text: 'Nextra Docs Template'
  },
  // add this to use our Search component
  search: {
    component: <Search />
  }
}
```

### Building the context

Here you will need the OpenAI token counting library `tiktoken` so run `npm i @dqbd/tiktoken`.

Now we are going to build the prompt to contextualise ChatGPT in a NextJS API endpoint.
Create a file `pages/api/buildPrompt.ts` with the code:

```ts
// pages/api/buildPrompt.ts
import { get_encoding } from '@dqbd/tiktoken'

// Load the tokenizer which is designed to work with the embedding model
const enc = get_encoding('cl100k_base')
const apiKey = process.env.EMBEDBASE_API_KEY

// this is how you search Embedbase with a string query
const search = async (query: string) => {
  return fetch(
    'https://embedbase-hosted-usx5gpslaq-uc.a.run.app/v1/documentation/search',
    {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        Authorization: 'Bearer ' + apiKey,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        query: query
      })
    }
  ).then(response => response.json())
}

const createContext = async (question: string, maxLen = 1800) => {
  // get the similar data to our query from the database
  const searchResponse = await search(question)
  let curLen = 0
  const returns = []
  // We want to add context to some limit of length (tokens)
  // because usually LLM have limited input size
  for (const similarity of searchResponse['similarities']) {
    const sentence = similarity['data']
    // count the tokens
    const nTokens = enc.encode(sentence).length
    // a token is roughly 4 characters, to learn more
    // https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936856-what-are-tokens-and-how-to-count-them
    curLen += nTokens + 4
    if (curLen > maxLen) {
      break
    }
    returns.push(sentence)
  }
  // we join the entries we found with a separator to show it's different
  return returns.join('\n\n###\n\n')
}

// this is the endpoint that returns an answer to the client
export default async function buildPrompt(req, res) {
  const prompt = req.body.prompt
  const context = await createContext(prompt)
  const newPrompt = `Answer the question based on the context below, and if the question can't be answered based on the context, say "I don't know"\n\nContext: ${context}\n\n---\n\nQuestion: ${prompt}\nAnswer:`
  res.status(200).json({ prompt: newPrompt })
}
```

### Making calls to ChatGPT

First add some utility function that is used to make stream calls to OpenAI in the file `utils/OpenAIStream.ts`, you'll need to install `eventsource-parser` by running `npm i eventsource-parser`.

```ts
import {
  createParser,
  ParsedEvent,
  ReconnectInterval
} from 'eventsource-parser'

export interface OpenAIStreamPayload {
  model: string
  // this is a list of messages to give ChatGPT
  messages: { role: 'user'; content: string }[]
  stream: boolean
}

export async function OpenAIStream(payload: OpenAIStreamPayload) {
  const encoder = new TextEncoder()
  const decoder = new TextDecoder()

  let counter = 0
  const res = await fetch('https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions', {
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY ?? ''}`
    },
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify(payload)
  })

  const stream = new ReadableStream({
    async start(controller) {
      // callback
      function onParse(event: ParsedEvent | ReconnectInterval) {
        if (event.type === 'event') {
          const data = event.data
          // https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions/create#completions/create-stream
          if (data === '[DONE]') {
            controller.close()
            return
          }
          try {
            const json = JSON.parse(data)
            // get the text response from ChatGPT
            const text = json.choices[0]?.delta?.content
            if (!text) return
            if (counter < 2 && (text.match(/\n/) || []).length) {
              // this is a prefix character (i.e., "\n\n"), do nothing
              return
            }
            const queue = encoder.encode(text)
            controller.enqueue(queue)
            counter++
          } catch (e) {
            // maybe parse error
            controller.error(e)
          }
        }
      }

      // stream response (SSE) from OpenAI may be fragmented into multiple chunks
      // this ensures we properly read chunks and invoke an event for each SSE event stream
      const parser = createParser(onParse)
      // https://web.dev/streams/#asynchronous-iteration
      for await (const chunk of res.body as any) {
        parser.feed(decoder.decode(chunk))
      }
    }
  })

  return stream
}
```

Then create a file `pages/api/qa.ts` which will be an endpoint to simply make a streaming call to ChatGPT.

```ts
// pages/api/qa.ts
import { OpenAIStream, OpenAIStreamPayload } from '../../utils/OpenAIStream'
export const config = {
  // We are using Vercel edge function for this endpoint
  runtime: 'edge'
}

interface RequestPayload {
  prompt: string
}

const handler = async (req: Request, res: Response): Promise<Response> => {
  const { prompt } = (await req.json()) as RequestPayload
  if (!prompt) {
    return new Response('No prompt in the request', { status: 400 })
  }
  const payload: OpenAIStreamPayload = {
    model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo',
    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: prompt }],
    stream: true
  }
  const stream = await OpenAIStream(payload)
  return new Response(stream)
}
export default handler
```

### Connect everything & Asking questions

Now it is time to ask questions through API calls.
Edit `theme.config.tsx` to add the function to the `Search` component:

```tsx
// theme.config.tsx
const Search = () => {
  const [open, setOpen] = useState(false)
  const [question, setQuestion] = useState('')
  const [answer, setAnswer] = useState('')
  const answerQuestion = async (e: any) => {
    e.preventDefault()
    setAnswer('')
    // build the contextualized prompt
    const promptResponse = await fetch('/api/buildPrompt', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        prompt: question
      })
    })
    const promptData = await promptResponse.json()
    // send it to ChatGPT
    const response = await fetch('/api/qa', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        prompt: promptData.prompt
      })
    })
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(response.statusText)
    }
    const data = response.body
    if (!data) {
      return
    }

    const reader = data.getReader()
    const decoder = new TextDecoder()
    let done = false
    // read the streaming ChatGPT answer
    while (!done) {
      const { value, done: doneReading } = await reader.read()
      done = doneReading
      const chunkValue = decoder.decode(value)
      // update our interface with the answer
      setAnswer(prev => prev + chunkValue)
    }
  }
  return (
    <>
      <input
        placeholder="Ask a question"
        onClick={() => setOpen(true)}
        type="text"
      />
      <Modal open={open} onClose={() => setOpen(false)}>
        <form onSubmit={answerQuestion} className="nx-flex nx-gap-3">
          <input
            placeholder="Ask a question"
            type="text"
            value={question}
            onChange={e => setQuestion(e.target.value)}
          />
          <button type="submit">Ask</button>
        </form>
        <p>{answer}</p>
      </Modal>
    </>
  )
}
```

You should have this by now:

Of course, feel free to improve the style 😁.

## Closing thoughts

In summary, we have:

- Created a Nextra documentation
- Prepared and store our documents in Embedbase
- Built an interface to get the user's query
- Searched for the context of the question in our database to provide ChatGPT
- Built the prompt with this context and call ChatGPT
- Let the user ask a question by connecting everything together

## Further reading

Embeddings are a machine learning concept that allows you to represent the semantics of your data as a number, which allows you to create features such as:

- semantic search (e.g., what is the similarity between "the cow eats grass" and "the monkey eats bananas", which also works for comparing images, etc.)
- recommendation systems (if you like the movie Avatar, you might like Star Wars)
- classification ("this movie is amazing" is a positive sentence, "this movie sucks" is a negative sentence)
- generative search (chat bot that answers questions about a pdf, a website, a youtube video, etc.)

Embeddings are not a new technology, but they have been made more popular, more general and more accessible recently thanks to the OpenAI embeddings endpoint which is fast and cheap.
We won't dive into the technical subject of embeddings, there is a lot of information about them on the internet.

AI embeddings can be thought of as a sorting hat of Harry Potter. Just like the sorting hat assigns houses based on the traits of the students, AI embeddings are assigned to similar content based on their features. When we want to find similar items, we can ask AI to provide us with embeddings of the items, and then calculate the distance between them. The closer the distance between the embeddings, the more similar the items. This process is similar to how the sorting hat uses the traits of each student to determine their best fit for a house. By using AI embeddings, we can quickly and easily compare items based on their features, resulting in smarter decisions and more efficient search results.

![https://towardsdatascience.com/creating-word-embeddings-coding-the-word2vec-algorithm-in-python-using-deep-learning-b337d0ba17a8](https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/SQxYEOAdnkcSKZL1GMNDR2C7ByW2-pz93vk4.png)

The method described above is simply to embed words, but today, sentences, images, sentences + images and many other things are possible.

When you want to use embeddings in a production software, there are some pitfalls to be careful with:

- All the infra of storing embeddings at scale
- Cost optimization (e.g. avoid calculating a data twice)
- Segmentation of user embeddings (you don't want your search function to display another user's data)
- Dealing with the model input size limit
- Integration with popular app infras (supabase, firebase, google cloud, etc.)

### Preparing the data continuously in GitHub Actions

The point of embeddings is to be able to index any kind of unstructured data, we want our documentation to be indexed every time we modify it, right? This is a GitHub action that will index every markdown file when a `git push` is done on the `main` branch:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/index.yaml
name: Index documentation
on:
	push:
		branches:
			- main
jobs:
	index:
		runs-on: ubuntu-latest
		steps:
			- uses: actions/checkout@v2
			- uses: actions/setup-node@v2
			with:
				node-version: 14
			- run: npm install
			- run: node scripts/sync.js
				env:
					EMBEDBASE_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.EMBEDBASE_API_KEY }}
```

Don't forget to add `EMBEDBASE_API_KEY` to your [GitHub secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets).
