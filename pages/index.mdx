## What are embeddings?

Embeddings are way to represent data in a way that makes it easy to find the "relatedness" between 2 or more data points. They're
powerful because they allow you to store unstructured data (aka things that don't fit tightly into JSON) and create searchable systems out of them.

Below, you'll find examples of what you can build with embeddings.

## Use cases

- Semantic Search (where results are ranked by relevance to a query string)
- Clustering (where text strings are grouped by similarity)
- Recommendations (where items with related text strings are recommended)
- Anomaly detection (where outliers with little relatedness are identified)
- Diversity measurement (where similarity distributions are analyzed)
- Classification (where text strings are classified by their most similar label)
