## Getting Started

To install the Embedbase-py library, run the following command:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/different-ai/embedbase-py
```

## Usage

### Initializing the Client

To get started, import the `EmbedbaseClient` class and create a new instance:

```python
from embedbase_client.client import EmbedbaseClient

embedbase_url = "https://api.embedbase.xyz"
embedbase_key = "your_api_key"
client = EmbedbaseClient(embedbase_url, embedbase_key)
```

### Searching Datasets

To search a dataset, call the `search` method on a `Dataset` object:

```python
dataset = client.dataset("your_dataset_name")
search_results = dataset.search("your_query", limit=5)
```

### Adding Data

To add data to a dataset, call the `add` method on a `Dataset` object:

```python
document = "your_document_text"
metadata = {"key": "value"}
result = dataset.add(document, metadata)
```

### Creating a Context

To create a context, call the `create_context` method on a `Dataset` object:

```python
query = "your_query"
context = dataset.create_context(query, limit=5)
```

### Splitting and Chunking Large Texts

To split and chunk large texts, use the `split_text` function from the `split` module:

```python
from embedbase_client.split import split_text

text = "your_long_text"
max_tokens = 500
chunk_overlap = 200

chunks = split_text(text, max_tokens, chunk_overlap)
```
